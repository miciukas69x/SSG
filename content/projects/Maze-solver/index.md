## Introduction

This project is a program that generates random mazes and then solves them step by step. I built it to practice recursion, breadth-first search, depth-first search, and handling both logic and visuals at the same time. Itâ€™s where algorithms stop being abstract and start drawing paths you can see.

## Core Features

- Maze generation: random walls, unique entrance and exit.
- Pathfinding: implemented DFS and BFS(not yet) to navigate the maze.
- Visualization: shows the maze and the solving process in real time.
- Backtracking: highlights explored dead ends with different colors.
- Unit tests: seperated pure logic from drawing so the algorithms can be tested cleanly.

## What I Learned

- Applied the theory (DFS, BFS) I've learned taking the DSA course. 
- How to combine recursion and state tracking without getting lost.
- Why separating logic from rendering makes testing and debugging easier.
- How small algorithms can come alive visually with just a few drawing calls.

## Conclusion

This project showed me that algorithms aren't just abstract puzzles - they can literally carve paths. Building the maze solver gave me hands-on experience with recursion, search strategies and visualization, while proving that algorithms practice can also be interactive and fun.
