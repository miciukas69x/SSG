## Introduction

This project is a modern take on the classic Asteroids arcade game. I built it to practice collision detection, rendering, and game loop logic. It was one of my first coding projects that combined fun gameplay with core programming concepts.

## Core Features

- Spaceship controls: rotate, thrust, shoot lasers.
- Asteroid generation: random spawn, random velocity, endless waves.
- Collision detection: bullets destroy asteroids, ship collides = game over.
- Score tracking: every asteroid destroyed adds to the score.
- Asteroid splitting: every shot asteroid splits into to smaller ones.

## What I Learned

- Basics of **game loops** and frame updates.
- Implementing **collision detection** (circle-based hitboxes).
- Structuring a small project into modules for readability.
- The satisfaction of creating something you can actually play.

## Conclusion

This project was both practice and proof: code doesn't have to be all data and finance - it can be a game too. Building asteroids gave me hands-on experience with logic, graphics, and debugging, while also reminding me why coding is fun in the first place.
