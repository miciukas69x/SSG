## Introduction

This project is a small AI agent I built using a free Google API as the language model backend. The goal was simple: understand the structure of AI agents, how they interact with APIs, and how to make them perform specific tasks automatically.

## Core Features

- Command-line interface for input and output
- Uses a free API endpoint as the LLM engine
- Basic tool calling (fetching data, returning results)
- Modular design for adding more tools or actions
- Logs interactions for debugging and iteration

## What I Learned

- How AI agents are structured (loop of input → model → action → response)
- The role of APIs in extending model capabilities
- Handling async tasks and API errors gracefully
- Why abstraction matters: separating the agent logic from the tools it can use
- That even a toy project can teach the fundamentals of bigger frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPTin songs, his tale remains an inspiration, an immortal testament to courage—a rarity that transcends time.

## Conclusion

The AI Agent project showed me that it’s not magic — it’s just code, APIs, and a loop. By building one from scratch, I demystified how agents work and laid the groundwork for more advanced projects that combine finance, coding, and automation.
