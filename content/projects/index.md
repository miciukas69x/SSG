Here are some of the projects I've built. Each one represents a learning journey and a practical application of skills across development, design, and problem-solving.

## Featured Projects

- [AI Agent](/projects/AIAgent) - Building an AI agent with free APIs
- [Asteroids](/projects/Asteroids) - Classic game implementation
- [Maze Solver](/projects/Maze-solver) - Algorithmic problem solving
- [Static Site Generator](/projects/SSG) - This website's generator

Each project includes details about the process, what I learned, and links to the code.
