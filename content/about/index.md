# About me

[< Back Home](/)

I'm Matas Michailinas, a developer, designer, and finance enthusiast. I build things that combine code, creativity, and practical problem-solving.

## What I Do

I work across three main areas:

- **Development**: Building software, tools, and systems from scratch
- **Design**: Creating interfaces and experiences that are both functional and beautiful
- **Finance**: Exploring the intersection of technology and financial systems

## Current Focus

I'm passionate about learning by building. Whether it's creating a static site generator, building AI agents, or solving algorithmic challenges, I believe the best way to understand something is to build it yourself.
