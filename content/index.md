## About me

I'm an aspiring young (19yo) gentleman drawn to programming because I enjoy the challenge 
of building and solving problems. Alongside that, I study finance, and I'm working 
toward blending the two into something meaningful (tools, projects, maybe even businesses).
Money matters, but for me it's more about the flow that comes from learning, experimenting,
and eventually turning skills into independence.
