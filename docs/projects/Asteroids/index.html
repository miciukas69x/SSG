It’s just you, some rocks flying at random, and the cold laws of collision detection. The rules are simple, but the challenge is always fresh — both for the player and the programmer."</blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/miciukas69x/asteroids">View on GitHub</a></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This project is a modern take on the classic Asteroids arcade game. I built it to practice collision detection, rendering, and game loop logic. It was one of my first coding projects that combined fun gameplay with core programming concepts.</p><h2>Core Features</h2><ul><li>Spaceship controls: rotate, thrust, shoot lasers.</li><li>Asteroid generation: random spawn, random velocity, endless waves.</li><li>Collision detection: bullets destroy asteroids, ship collides = game over.</li><li>Score tracking: every asteroid destroyed adds to the score.</li><li>Asteroid splitting: every shot asteroid splits into to smaller ones.</li></ul><h2>What I Learned</h2><ul><li>Basics of <b>game loops</b> and frame updates.</li><li>Implementing <b>collision detection</b> (circle-based hitboxes).</li><li>Structuring a small project into modules for readability.</li><li>The satisfaction of creating something you can actually play.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This project was both practice and proof: code doesn't have to be all data and finance - it can be a game too. Building asteroids gave me hands-on experience with logic, graphics, and debugging, while also reminding me why coding is fun in the first place.</p></div>
